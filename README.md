# Determinants of political radicalization

# Project Overview

The increasing ideological polarization of political debates and the rising frequency of terrorism-related events pose serious risks to the security and stability of societies.

This project aims to examine the determinants of terrorist radicalization as theorized by social and psychological literature, and to identify which factors have an actual explanatory power regarding the approval of terrorism as a tool for political, ideological, or religious struggle.

To achieve this, a large, high-quality dataset—long recognized in social research—was used, and supervised learning techniques were applied to analyze the data.

# Data and Methodology

A high-quality public dataset was used: the World Values Survey.

A sample of Armenian participants was selected, a country historically affected by terrorism-related phenomena.

Analyses were conducted to test the relationship between social-psychological determinants and support for terrorism.

# Key Findings

The data do not meet the assumptions required for ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation.

The tested model is underspecified.

Studying theories of terrorist radicalization from a social-psychological perspective requires a high-dimensional variable space and methods suitable for handling complex relationships.

Recommendations for Future Research

Future studies using datasets similar to the one employed here should:

Use statistical models capable of handling high-dimensional data.

Maintain flexibility in methodological approaches (e.g., classification vs. regression).

Adopt theoretical models that allow for precise operationalization of variables.
